     Given the user to access the url with all the records
     When save objects in a JSON array
     Then the user validate the data object "<id>", "<albumId>", "<title>", "<url>" e "<thumbnailUrl>" must be as expected

Scenario: API - GET request looking for a specific object
    Given I make a request to the endpoint searching for name "alias odio sit"
    Then the response status code should be "200"
    And the email of the returned object should be "Lew@alysha.tv"

Scenario: API - POST request including a new user
    Given I make a POST to the endpoint users including the user with the values "<name>", "<username>", "<email>", "<street>", "<suite>", "<city>", "<zipcode>", "<lat>", "<lng>", "<phone>", "<website>", "<nameCompany>", "<catchPhrase>" e "<bs>"
    Then the response status code for POST should be "201"
    And the id of the response should be returned

    Examples:
    |name          |username|email      |street        |suite|city         |zipcode  |lat     |lng    |phone   |website    |nameCompany |catchPhrase |bs          |
